As someone in the midst of physiotherapy, I've got a routine of over 10 exercises scheduled 5 times a week. But I realized I've fallen into a bit of a habit - taking longer breaks between each exercise or set than I should. To help with this, I've developed an app that keeps track of how long I spend on each exercise and on breaks. It kindly reminds me with notifications when it's time to get back into my exercises.

## Usage
The home page allows users to view the list of exercises of the user. Clicking on the exercises will allow the user to view the exercise in detail.<br />
